# Bundler Bug with Git Cached Gems

## Initial setup

To get started, clone this repo locally, `cd` into that directory, and switch to the `wrong_structure` branch:

```console
git switch wrong_structure
```

## Build successfully with older Bundler

We've set a `BUNDLER_VERSION` argument in the Dockerfile to a known working version: `2.5.10`.

Build the Docker image (naming it "cache_bug"):

```console
docker build --no-cache --tag=cache_bug --progress=plain ./
```

Then run the `hello` executable:

```console
docker run -it cache_bug
```

### What do we expect to happen?

If you look at the build output you'll notice that the RubyGem dependencies were not met, so they were installed.
Those Gems are vendored in `vendor/cache` and we `COPY`'d that entire directory into the image.
So they were installed from the cache, as expected.

```log
#11 [5/6] RUN gem install bundler -v 2.5.10 --no-document &&     bundle _2.5.10_ config set --local deployment "true" &&     bundle _2.5.10_ config set --local path "vendor/bundle" &&     bundle _2.5.10_ check || bundle _2.5.10_ install --local --retry=3 &&     bundle _2.5.10_ clean

#11 0.825 Install missing gems with `bundle install`
#11 0.999 Installing nio4r 2.7.4 with native extensions
#11 3.109 Installing puma 6.4.3 with native extensions
#11 5.237 Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 4 gems now installed.
#11 5.237 Bundled gems are installed into `./vendor/bundle`
#11 DONE 5.4s
```

## Trigger the bug

Open the `Dockerfile` and change `BUNDLER_VERSION` to `2.5.23`, which is the latest Bundler release as of today.
Re-build the image:

```console
docker build --no-cache --tag=cache_bug --progress=plain ./
```

Bundler will again see that the dependencies are not satisfied.
But rather than install from the `vendor/cache`, it fetches the git-sourced dependency (puma-plugin-telemetry) from GitHub.

```log
#11 [5/6] RUN gem install bundler -v 2.5.23 --no-document &&     bundle _2.5.23_ config set --local deployment "true" &&     bundle _2.5.23_ config set --local path "vendor/bundle" &&     bundle _2.5.23_ check || bundle _2.5.23_ install --local --retry=3 &&     bundle _2.5.23_ clean
#11 0.595 Successfully installed bundler-2.5.23
#11 0.595 1 gem installed
#11 0.829 Bundler can't satisfy your Gemfile's dependencies.
#11 0.829 Install missing gems with `bundle install`.
#11 0.997 Fetching https://github.com/stevenharman/puma-plugin-telemetry.git
#11 1.722 Installing nio4r 2.7.4 with native extensions
#11 3.771 Installing puma 6.4.3 with native extensions
#11 5.874 Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 4 gems now installed.
#11 5.874 Bundled gems are installed into `./vendor/bundle`
#11 DONE 6.0s
```

Even though the Git-sourced dependency is in `vendor/cache`, Bundler is fetching it from the GitHub.
I suspect this is due to the cache structure being the "old" shallow checkout structure?

## Try the new structure

At this point on my machine (outside of the Docker image) I deleted the git-sourced directory from `vendor/cache`, switched to the latest Bundler, and re-installed the Git-sourced dependency.
I then committed that to Git.
That is, I did this (but you don't need to):

```console
rm -rf vendor/cache/puma-plugin-telemetry-d904b8429739
gem install bundler -v 2.5.23
bundle _2.5.23_ install
git add --all && git commit
```

Instead of all of that, please check out the `new_structure` branch with those changes already done.

```console
git switch new_structure
```

### And now?

Building the image fails for a different Git-looking reason.
Though, this is expected (in hindsight):

```log
#11 [5/6] RUN gem install bundler -v 2.5.10 --no-document &&     bundle _2.5.10_ config set --local deployment "true" &&     bundle _2.5.10_ config set --local path "vendor/bundle" &&     bundle _2.5.10_ check || bundle _2.5.10_ install --local --retry=3 &&     bundle _2.5.10_ clean

```

We're still using the older Bundler version here!
Updating the `Dockerfile`'s `BUNDLER_VERSION` to `2.5.23` results in a clean build, without fetching from the remote.

Please checkout the "final_state" branch.

## Final state

With the structure updated to the one expected by newer Bundler, and being sure we're running a newer Bundler, we can successfully build without fetching from the remote.
It is interesting that leaving the `Gemfile.lock`'s `BUNDLED WITH` set to `2.5.10` didn't seem to matter, so long as we were running the later Bundler version (`2.5.23`).
That is, we could also build with that set to the older version.

For completeness, I also updated it via `bundle _2.5.23_ update --bunlder`.
We can still successfully build with that as well.


## Where does this leave us?

The gnarly user experience of needing to re-build all `vendor/cache` for each Git-sourced Gem.
That's pretty rough.

And if you don't do that, then newer Bundler version (e.g., `2.5.23`) will still attempt to fetch Git-sourced Gems from the remote, even if they're already in `vendor/cache`.
This feels like a bug to me.
But ðŸ¤·â€¦

Should we go back to the old cache format?
Maybe?

But at the very least it seems we need a way for users to migrate the format cleanly, and with as little confusion as possible.
